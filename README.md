# OFDM_model
My educational project on creating an OFDM transmitter and receiver
For start this project you have to install Matlab or use MatLab online. Then start the main_OFDM.m file. Other files must be in the same folder.
This project contains OFDM transmitter and receiver  and it can show how OFDM works (thanks to huge comments in russian languadge and a lot of plotting graphs.
It is my old project which was made 2 years ago. It must work but I don`t start it for a long time
